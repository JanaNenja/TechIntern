# TechIntern
This repository contains the code of our senior project. The application brings together all the companies that offer training programs for training seekers. This will make it easy for them to display all programs in one place, enabling them to search for companies in several ways, then apply to companies easily, and then they can see their status stages of the track. As for companies, they can post their offers, so when anyone submits to offers, it will be easy for them to filter candidates through certain points, and after they decide, they can inform the candidates of the result. The following figure will illustrate system through the icons.
